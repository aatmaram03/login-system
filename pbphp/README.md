This is my mini PHP project.I love Backend Web development. 
The frontend of this project is not mine i have dowloaded it from an open source. 
currently i have just designed the register and login feature with password encryption for this facebook clone website. In future i am going to add more features such as OTP authentication, etc. 

for now this is the best project i have :( 
this projects represents my knowledge of RDBMS and php. 
but in future i am going to make very cool projects as a backend web developer. ðŸ™Œ

I have recording of the working of the website can be visible in the folder of source code.



best regards,
